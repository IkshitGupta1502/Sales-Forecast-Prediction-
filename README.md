# Sales Forecasting using XGBoost
## Introduction
Accurately predicting sales is crucial for businesses to make informed decisions about inventory management, marketing strategies, and resource allocation. This project utilizes a sales dataset to forecast future sales trends, considering factors such as historical sales data and temporal patterns.
## Project Overview
The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning models to provide insights into sales trends. Key technical aspects include:
- Data Preprocessing: Handling date formats and creating time series data.
- Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features such as lagged sales data.
- Machine Learning Models: XGBoost Regressor with hyperparameter tuning.
- Model Evaluation: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and model performance visualization.
## Importance and Applications
Sales forecasting models play a vital role in:
- Inventory Management: Optimizing stock levels based on predicted sales.
- Marketing Strategies: Informing marketing decisions with data-driven insights.
- Resource Allocation: Allocating resources effectively based on predicted sales trends.
## Methodology
- Data Collection: A sales dataset was obtained and utilized for training and testing.
- Data Preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned and transformed into a suitable format.
- Feature Engineering: Key features were extracted, including lagged sales data.
- Model Evaluation: The XGBoost model was trained and evaluated using RMSE.
## Results
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the XGBoost model in predicting sales trends, with an RMSE of 734.63. The model's performance is visualized through actual vs. predicted sales plots.
## Next Steps
- Incorporating Additional Features: Exploring additional features such as seasonality and external economic factors.
- Advanced Machine Learning Models: Experimenting with other machine learning models such as LSTM or Prophet.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Further optimizing hyperparameters for improved model performance.
## Technical Details
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Manual tuning of XGBoost hyperparameters.
- Model Performance Visualization: Visualizing model performance using actual vs. predicted sales plots.
